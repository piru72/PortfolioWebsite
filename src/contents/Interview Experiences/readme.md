## Written Exam 
The written exam had 5 parts in total

### English
There were 5/6 question on some basic english like What does "man of straw" means, finding out relation between two object , prepositions .

### Mathmatical

This part was all about math there were several math all of them were mostly below class 10 maths and needed basic algebra. Just had to build some equation and find out the answer. One question was about train where two trains lenght and their speed was given and the time to cross each train was required.

### IQ test
Some patterns were given and we were required to find the match or dismatch this part was just like any regular IQ test.

### Verval Reasoning
This was the most interesting part of the question where you will be given some situation and you have to make reasons to come to a point where you are certain about some information from the given information or you are asked to predict if the given information were enough to make the assumptions.
