# Poly Alphabetic Cipher

A poly-alphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using several substitution
alphabets. In polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, the plaintext letters are enciphered
differently based upon their installation in the text. Rather than being a one-to-one
correspondence, there is a one-to-many relationship between each letter and its substitutes.
For example, ‘a’ can be enciphered as ‘d’ in the starting of the text, but as ‘n’ at the middle.
